# Demo Project - Next.js Dashboard Application

## Framework

- Next.js 16+ with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for all styling

## Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Keep components focused and composable
- Use the cn() utility for conditional classNames
- Favor named exports for components

## Folder Structure

- Page components go in app/ directory
- Reusable components go in components/
- UI primitives go in components/ui/
- Layout components go in components/layout/
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)

## Naming Conventions

- All components should be named like new-component.tsx
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories
- Favor named exports for components

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Use proper typing for all props and function parameters

## Theming

- Always use CSS variable-based colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, etc.)
- Never hardcode hex colors - use Tailwind classes that map to CSS variables
- This allows easy brand customization
- Update :root CSS variables in globals.css to customize the theme

## UI and Styling

- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints
- Test all layouts on mobile viewport
- Make sure everything you produce is mobile-friendly
- Keep UI consistent across pages
- Use modern UI/UX design patterns

## Component Customization

- Look for CUSTOMIZE comments to find customization points
- Update sidebar navigation in layout/sidebar.tsx
- Update user info in layout/header.tsx
- Update dashboard content in app/page.tsx

## Animations

- Use Tailwind transitions for simple effects
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations (if added)
- Keep animations subtle and professional

## Accessibility and Content

- Include proper semantic HTML
- Ensure accessibility (alt texts, ARIA labels)
- Use realistic placeholder content
- Follow WCAG guidelines

## Performance

- Minimize re-renders
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Optimize images with next/image

## Package Manager

- Use pnpm
- Use pnpm lint for linting fixes
- Use pnpm dev for development server
- Use pnpm build for production builds
